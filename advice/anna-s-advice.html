                <h4>What am I doing here?</h4>

                <p>At first, I wasn't sure why I was really learning this, and how I could apply it to my life. It felt overwhelming to have a full time job, a 2 year old, a global pandemic putting everything upside down, and a new coding <em>hobby</em>.</p>
                <p>It's daunting to step foot into a new arena on a hunch. I know the future is tech, and I don't want to miss out on any opportunities due to preconceived notions of the industry. </p>
                <p>Every day I was a little more motivated and a touch more confident in the skills I was learning. Slowly, I dared to dream of a new future for my family.</p>
              </div>
                <h4>It's like cologne, a little goes a long way.</h4>

                <p>We all have excuses as to why we procrastinate. I am the primary breadwinner in my family, and am lucky to have a partner who does an amazing job supporting me in my quests for enhancement. He knows that I need an hour daily to keep the momentum going. When I have a lighter work day, I take my laptop with me and crush a few lessons throughout the day.
                </p>
                <p>With the lessons being bite sized, it is amazing how easy it is to see progress!</p>
